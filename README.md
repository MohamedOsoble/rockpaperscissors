# Rock Paper Scissors.

## Description
A very simple game written in Python 3. The user opens the application and selects one of three choices. The computer then selects one of three choices using pythons random library. A game is then played based off both choices through a series of conditional statements. The user then receives feedback based on the computer's choice and outcome of the match.

## Installation
Considering the simplicity of the game, there are no installation instructions. Simply copy/paste the code into a python 3 interpretor. Required modules to run the GUI version of the game is PySimpleGUI only. 

## Usage
### Terminal Version:

Copy/paste the code into a python interpretor and run the file. The terminal will tell you what to enter in order to play a game against the computer.

### GUI Version:

Copy/paste the code into a python interpretor and run the file (requires PySimpleGUI). Press one of the buttons on the screen to play a game against the computer.

## Roadmap
Currently looking to improve the structure and design of the code in the following ways:
1. Add a how to play section to explain the rules
2. Perhaps use images instead of text for the buttons
3. Use a for-loop for the buttons that select the player input choice

## Contributing
This is just a very simple project to start off my portfolio but if you wish to use this template of the game and make your own changes or improvements. You're very welcome to.

## Project status
I will eventually make improvements to this project to improve how I approach the design elements when building applications
